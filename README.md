# ShinyApp
This repo contains the Shiny app for the Coursera "Developing Data Products" course.  I followed the Shiny tutorial and put all of my code in one file instead of creating separate server.R and ui.R files.  The tutorial suggested that having separate files is the old way of creating apps.
